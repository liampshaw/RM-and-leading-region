# Restriction-modification targets and the leading region of plasmids

A repository for scripts related to analysis for upcoming paper. 

The workflow is as follows:


We used a dataset of the 50 most prevalent plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs) in RefSeq200: 4,753 plasmids across 37 genera. These are available [here](url)
We ran Prokka followed by Roary to generate pangenomes for each PTU using scripts available [here](https://github.com/Adalijuanluo/Plasmid_pan).
 
The pangenome data is available for download via Zenodo at [here](url). 
Combined hard shell and accessory fastas for each PTU are available [here](url). In these files the headers of the sequences give information on the genes with `seq_ID|gene_family` e.g. `>NC_019083.1_00042|group_17`
